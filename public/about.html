<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My Name is Laura Salazar, I am 47 years old and a mom of 2 amazing boys, Alejandro 18 and Sebastian 16.  
  They are my entire world. We do also have a mischevious dog by the name of Winston. We live in San Jose 
  Costa Rica. </p>
<p>Costa Rica is a small country located in the middle of Central America.  Costa Rica has a population of 
  roughly 6.5 to 7 million people.  This country has amazing weather, beaches and tropical forests.  Don't 
  be fooled by its small size because it certainly packs alot into a small size. .</p>

<p>My the kids and myself live very normal lives and we are content with all the thigs we have been able to 
  experience.  I strive to be able to give them as much opportunities as I possibly can and try my best to 
manage our lives in "pura vida"</p>
